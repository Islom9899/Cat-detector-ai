Cat Detector AI
This project is a simple deep learning model built using the fastai library to classify images as Cat or Not Cat. The entire development and testing process was done in Google Colab.

Demo
Upload an image and get instant classification with probability.

Example 1
Input Image:

Prediction:
cat: False  
accuracy_probability: 0.001
---
Example 2
Input Image:

Prediction:
cat: True  
accuracy_probability: 1.000
